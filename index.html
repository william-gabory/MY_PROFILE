			<h1>Hi everyone ! Here is William.</h1>

			<p>
				I am a passionate sports enthusiast who thrives on the thrill of competition. My two favorite sports are handball and running, and I enjoy nothing more than pushing myself to the limit in both. Whether I'm on the court or hitting the pavement, I love the rush of adrenaline that comes with the challenge of testing my physical and mental limits. When I'm not practicing or training, I can often be found cheering on my favorite teams or athletes, always striving to learn more about what it takes to succeed at the highest levels of sports competition.

			<h2>Why I love handball</h2>
			<p>
				I love handball because it's a fast-paced and challenging team sport that requires both physical and mental skills. It also offers opportunities to develop important life skills and fosters a strong sense of community and camaraderie within the team.

			<h2>Why I love running</h2>
			<p>
				It allows me to enjoy the beauty of nature and the fresh air, which helps me to feel more alive and energized. I find that running outside provides a welcome break from the monotony of indoor exercise and allows me to clear my mind and enjoy some peaceful solitude. I love the sense of accomplishment and endorphin rush that comes with completing a challenging outdoor run, which helps me to feel both physically and mentally strong.

			<h2>What does the competition bring me?</h2>
			<p>
				Competing in sports is an incredibly valuable and rewarding experience for me. Not only does it provide me with the opportunity to test my skills and abilities against others, but it also allows me to push myself to new levels of performance and achievement. When I compete, I am able to set specific goals for myself and work tirelessly to achieve them, which gives me a great sense of accomplishment and satisfaction.
